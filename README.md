#Getting started

# TelstraSMSAUSLib

This API SDK was automatically generated by [APIMATIC v2.0](https://apimatic.io).

## Configuration

The SDK might need to be configured with your API credentials. Set your configuration in the `Configuration.js` file.

## Requirements

The SDK relies on AngularJS framework being available. See the [AngularJS website](https://angularjs.org/) for how to include AngularJS in your project.

## Usage

The following shows how import the controllers and use:

1. Add the folder `TelstraSMSAUSLib` into your to your scripts folder.
2. Import the reference to these files inside the appropriate html file such as `index.html`. The `Configuration.js` file should be imported before the other files.

    ```html
    <!-- Helper files -->
    <script src="scripts/TelstraSMSAUSLib/Configuration.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/TelstraSMSAUSLib/APIHelper.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/TelstraSMSAUSLib/Http/Client/HttpContext.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/TelstraSMSAUSLib/Http/Client/RequestClient.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/TelstraSMSAUSLib/Http/Request/HttpRequest.js"></script>
    <script src="scripts/TelstraSMSAUSLib/Http/Response/HttpResponse.js"></script>

    <!-- API Controllers -->
    <script src="scripts/TelstraSMSAUSLib/Controllers/APIController.js"></script>


    ```

3. Inject the module into your main module e.g:

    ```js
    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['TelstraSMSAUSLib']);
    ```

4. To use a generated factory in your controller, injection could be as follows:

    ```js
    myApp.controller('PageCtrl', function($scope, APIController) {
        ...
    }
    ```

5. You can call any of the controller functions. The value returned will be a promise. For example:

    ```js
    var response = APIController.createSMSMessage();
    ```

6. The context of response can be obtained by using `getContext()` function like:

    ```js
    response.then(function(data) {
        console.log(data.getContext());
    }, function(err) {
        ...
    });
    ```
